        1.  I have selected several video tutorials from YouTube, after watching which, you can easily link cute things on the subject of BT21 (link method) 
		<p>DON'T FORGET TO TURN ON THE VPN</p>
		<br> <a href="https://youtu.be/1F29Rja1BNY?si=COq_d1afBlpcv40o">Cute key chains of Koya and Cooky characters. On the author's channel, you can find tutorials on key rings with the rest of the characters.</a><br>
		<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5wu7RuXkvEgD0DpATQArC5WLE60-louE&si=isGN3HCwP89IJwHi">Here are tutorials for toys of all BT21 characters</a><br>
		<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJFU9SDXliYg84m0xQ--QqViYI18Kuueu&si=vj0JLKXGoetnvsph">A wonderful playlist, which contains a lot of videos on creating different things with characters and symbols of the BTS universe, as well as dolls of the participants themselves</a><br>
		<a href="https://youtu.be/qOFqG-DUFco?si=uyMks9E7mlZ5lIFl">Mang eyeglasses holder</a><br></h4>
	<center><h5>Tutorials are convenient and understandable due to the patterns that accompany the video. If you can read the patterns and know the abbreviations of knitting terminology, then the process will bring you great pleasure. <br>And for those who are not yet familiar with English-language designations, I have prepared a list of definitions, which you can find by returning to the main page. <br>It's not difficult at all, but it's incredibly useful! You'll definitely be able to do it, and very soon you'll discover a huge world of cool (and not scary!) foreign master classes.</h5></center>
        <h4>2. And below you can watch the voiceover of the video that officially opened BTS FESTA 2025 (frame method)
